# ATX to Extron Emotia PSU Adapter

Please please please know what you are doing and be careful if you decide to use this. It is untested and if I got something backwards it could fry your emotia.

That aside, this should let you power your emotia downscaler with an off the shelf psu instead of shelling out for a very expensive OEM one.

# Version 0.1
